# 🧠 Multi-Module Web Application

This project is a comprehensive Java-based web application that demonstrates enterprise-level architecture using microservices, RESTful APIs, and dynamic front-end interfaces. It simulates a real-world e-commerce and banking ecosystem with modular components for service discovery, user interaction, and transaction management.
Additionally, a Banking Application (with JDBC) is included, which connects to a database for basic banking operations.
